= Plan

There are two components to our system:

    redis-carbon  <->  redis

Redis Carbon has two kinds of clients: Graphite readers and Graphite writers.


== Graphite protocol server

Listen on port 2003 by default. Accept TCP connections with message contents:

    path value timestamp\n

`path` is a Graphite metric path: 

    word := [A-Za-z0-9_]+ // or (\S|./)+ ?
    path := word(.word)+

`value` is a string representation of a float.

`timestamp` is a UNIX epoch.

There is a finite state machine that describes how to handle a message:

    1. Receive raw message.
    2. Parse message into (path, value, timestamp).
    3. Validate path and value.
    4. Send 'value' to Redis stream 'path'.
    4. Done.
    E. Log error.

The state flow is:

    digraph G {
        receive -> parse -> validate -> send -> done
        receive -> error
        parse -> error
        validate -> error
        send -> error
    }

Keep track of messages received, sent and errored.


== Carbon server

The graphite-web API is somewhat documented here:

    https://graphite-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#

The carbon API is a bit simpler.

=== /render

Request arguments:

    target: metric name; may contain wildcards
    from: epoch
    to: epoch
    format: json, protobuf, pickle

We resolve any wildcards into a list of metric paths. For each path, we issue:

    XRANGE path from_ms to_ms [count]

We resample the return values into buckets according to the metric retention.
(Automatically figure out what retention to apply, based on from and until?)
We need to read a config file to infer the retentions and aggregation functions.

The config files we need to read are:

    https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf
    https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-aggregation-conf

=== /metrics

We need to be able to see the metric tree to answer these queries.

Stream names are just normal Redis keys. We seem to have two option to
distinguish those from other keys:

1. Use Redis namespaces to only write streams to a given namespace
2. Use a common prefix for metric streams 

(1) sounds nice, but what namespace a client writes to is a property of the
connection we're using and needs to be set every time. It seems fragile, and
that we'd want to do (2) for defense anyway.

For (2), we can prefix metric stream keys with something like `metric:` and
use `SCAN $C MATCH metric:*` to iterate through those keys.

For `/metrics/find` we can match keys against the query during the iteration.
For `/metrics/index.json` we don't need to filter anything. I'm not sure what
`/metrics/expand` does. (Googles... looks like it only returns the metric names
from a `/metrics/find` call?)

=== Dealing with wildcards

The `/metrics/find` endpoint returns interesting things. If we have a metric
`foo.bar.spam.eggs`, and query for `foo.*.spam.*`, it will return:

    foo.bar.spam.*
        expandable: yes
        leaf: no

However, if we'd get `foo.*.spam.*` in a render request, we'd want to expand it
directly to `foo.bar.spam.eggs`.

Another question is how to deal with leaf/not-leaf. If we're using Redis as a
backend, we can only detect leaf nodes. If we'd query for `foo.bar.*`, we'd
expect to match `foo.bar.spam.eggs`, but should return only the match:

    foo.bar.spam
        expandable: yes
        leaf: no

I should go read what people think they mean by these find return values.

ACTUALLY: Read what go-carbon does.
